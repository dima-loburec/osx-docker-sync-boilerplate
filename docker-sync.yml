# The rsync has drasticly faster inital syncronization, but implements a one way sync only (from local to containter)
# and deleting files on the host does yet not delete them on the container

# -l, --links
# When symlinks are encountered, recreate the symlink on the destination.
# -L, --copy-links
# When symlinks are encountered, the item that they point to (the referent) is copied
# -k, --copy-dirlinks
# This option causes the sending side to treat a symlink to a directory as though it were a real directory.
